# SargassumWindageVideos

## Introduction

In the summer of 2023, clumps of *Sargassum* were collected in the Gulf Stream off the southern coast of the Florida Peninsula, belonging to various species, mainly *Fluitans* and *Nathans I* and *VII*.

A series of laboratory experiments were carried out in the **A**ir-**S**ea **I**nteraction **S**alt-water **T**ank (ASIST) of the Alfred G. Glassell, Jr. **SU**rge **ST**ructure **A**tmosphere **IN**teraction ([SUSTAIN](https://sustain.rsmas.miami.edu/)) facility of the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The purpose of the experiments was to measure the effect of windage on the motion of *Sargassum* in a controlled environment. The water current speed was fixed, and the wind speed was varied over a range of fan frequencies.

This repository contains videos of the clumps floating in the tank. Due to file size constraints, only a subset of the videos are uploaded here. Please contact the [Nonlinear Dynamics group](https://nonlinear.earth.miami.edu/index.html) at the University of Miami if you are interested in the full set.
